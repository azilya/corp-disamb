Machine learning training scripts for my research.

Includes 3 example datasets, and scripts for preparing a dataset from csv data and training an SVM model, based on it.

To create a dataset you will need three csv files of following format: form,lemma,morhology.
Scripts are oriented towards mystem vs Freeling comparison and need to be changed to use with other taggers.
